# 3D-Indentation
Code and technical information corresponding to manuscript NCOMMS-20-20823-T

The Matlab code has been used for the evaluation of mechanical characterisations of pollen grains as well as C. elegans. Using indentation-based characterisations, the local apparent stiffness of the corresponding specimen has been calculated.

For demonstration purposes, two indentations performed on different regions of a single Lilium longiflorum pollen grain, i.e. on the intine as well as exine, have been made available. Additionally, indentations data for solid glass is available to detect the internal stiffness of the setup and allow for the corresponding correction of the experimental result.

Furthermore, to simplify reproducibility of the experiments through interested readers, the technical drawing of the sensor holder (designed and fabricated by Daniel Bollier) and a .dxf of the mask used for the soft-lithography fabrication of the acoustic manipulation device (designed and fabrication by Nino LÃ¤ubli) have been made available.
